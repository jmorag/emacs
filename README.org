NOTE:
This is no longer my emacs config that I work from. The current one lives [[https://github.com/jmorag/.emacs.d][here]].

*Emacs repository
* DONE write readme
* TODO setup git and projectile
* TODO setup python
* DONE bind more keys, specifically rebind help so we can use C-hjkl for window movement
